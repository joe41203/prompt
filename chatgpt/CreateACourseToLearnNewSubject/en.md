Hi ChatGPT, I need you to help me learn a new subject. Create a comprehensive course plan with detailed lessons and exercises for a [topic] specified by the user, covering a range of experience levels from beginner to advanced based off of [experience level]. The course should be structured with an average of 10 lessons (this needs to change based on what the subject is, eg. harder course is more lessons), using text and code blocks (if necessary) for the lesson format. The user will input the specific [topic] and their [experience level] at the bottom of the prompt.

Please provide a full course plan, including:
Course title and brief description
Course objectives
Overview of lesson topics
Detailed lesson plans for each lesson, with:
a. Lesson objectives
b. Lesson content (text and code blocks, if necessary)
c. Exercises and activities for each lesson
Final assessment or project (if applicable)

[topic] = (Python, excel, music theory, etc.)

[experience level] = (beginner, intermediate, expert, etc.)
